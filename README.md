## Project Proposal and Outline
For our project, we want to extract intraday forex trading data and anaylize trading windows with the most volitality to determine if we could predict market oppurtunites to capitilize on establish work day pattern arbitrage using statisitcal models and machine learning. 

## Conclusion

We found that the most volaitle time window was between 3AM EST and 10AM EST by comparing the average hourly volatility per day.

Using Bolinger bands, Simple moving average, and Exponential moving average approach to find signals within the data, we then used the outcome to predict positive returns with the Random Forrest machine learning method.
